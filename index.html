      <p class="bg-primary p-3 mx-3 mt-3 border rounded border-primary" id="bBlue">Hi, my name is Storm Crozier. 
        I am a senior at Portland State University majoring in Computer Science.  
        I am originally from Maui, Hawaii, and I came to Portland for the city and education.  
        I came to college right after high school, I had no idea what I wanted to study.  
        I spent my freshman year majoring in criminal justice and playing football for Portland State.  
        Once summer came I decided to try something new. I stopped playing football and switched my major to computer science.  
        I don’t have any experience in computer science, but I am excited to learn and be a part of it.  
        I want to work for a company actively doing something to improve our environment.  
        I believe that software will play a big role, whether it’s running simulations, creating websites for recognition, 
        or even inventing new technologies to reverse our carbon emissions or something along those lines.

        <h1 class="display-6 text-center">Restaurant Organizer</h1>
        <p class="col-lg-6 float-left">This was a project for an object-oriented class.  
          This is one of my first times using Java; I have experimented with java before this project but nothing as big as this.  
          This program read in from an external file of restaurants, and these restaurants could be real or fake.  
          The restaurants are stored in a binary search tree, and each restaurant has a liner-linked list.  
          These linear linked lists are filled with menu items from that restaurant.  
          This project used a lot of object-oriented designs like polymorphism and dynamic binding to name a few.</p>

        </a>
        <p class="col-lg-6 float-right">This is a project that was an assignment for an object-oriented class.  
          It used an array to represent the days of the week and a doubly-linked list to represent activities to do for that day.  
          This was a relatively simple project and was my first time using an inheritance hierarchy.  
          This program was helpful for planning out some of my days, and I might expand on it in the future.</p>

        <h1 class="display-6 text-center">Web Scraping</h1>
        <p class="">This is a small script that I made while experimenting with python and web scraping. I have used
          python before but never attempted web scraping. For this small project, I used a python library called
          beautiful soup. This library has a beautiful soup object which takes the HTML from a web page and parses it
          into an object. That object can then be parsed by using HTML tags to get the information you are looking for.
          The information I was looking for was average covid cases for a specific area, the area I was using was
          Hawaii. The information was printed to the customer and also saved in an excel worksheet with the day and all
          the averages for that day. </p>
